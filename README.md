########3 Election_Analysis
Python Based
This challege required the incorporation of multiple if statements in for loops coupled with a few other deviations from the module pypoll. This was a very challenging code breakdown which required the student to further understand how vs script interacted with folders and gitbash. the student, through multiple hours, finally understood what the teacher was trying to relay about moving though directories. What a challenge. I'm a very grateful for both TA's who were amazing and the multiple student collaboration who helped walk through and understand the process.

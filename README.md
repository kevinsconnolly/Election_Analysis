########3 Election_Analysis
### Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me a task which was to audit the most recent local congressional election.


1. Calculate the total number of congressional votes
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winnder of the election based on popular vote
6. Calculate largest county turnout


## Resources
- Data Source: Election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

-There were "369,711" votes cast in the election.

  - Candidate Charles Casper Stockham received "23%" of the vote and "85,213" number of votes
  - Candidate Diana DeGette received "73.8%" of the vote and "272,892" number of votes
  - Candidate Raymon Anthony Doane received "3.1%" of the vote and "11,606" number of votes
- The Winnder of the election was:
  - Candidate Diana DeGette, who received "73.8%" of the vote and the "272,892" number of votes
  


This challege required the incorporation of multiple if statements in "for loops" coupled with a few other deviations from the module pypoll. This was a very challenging code breakdown which required the student to further understand how vs script interacted with folders and gitbash. the student, through multiple hours, finally understood what the teacher was trying to relay about moving though directories. What a challenge. I'm a very grateful for both TA's who were amazing and the multiple student collaboration who helped walk through and understand the process.
